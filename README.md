# Mental Health in the Technology Sector

This is a repo designated for my Data Analytics Master's Thesis. This project seeks to better understand mental health in the technology sector due to the high rates of stress, burnout, and mental disorders found in the field. 
While there are large volumes of research conducted on mental health in the workplace, limited research has been performed with a focus on tech.

## Research Questions
Two questions are asked:
  1. Do technology sector workers have a higher probability of facing negative consequences when discussing a mental health issue with their employer compared to employees in other sectors?
  2. Do technology sector workers have less of a likelihood to discuss a mental health issue with their direct supervisor(s) compared to employees in other sectors?

## Data
This data was accquired through a survey conducted by the non-profit organization OSMI (Open Sourcing Mental Illness) in 2014:       Â https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cr65P3ciL2tD4W4KOCTz4Ik67iD52S_DKHXypqgta2o/edit?usp=sharing

## Method
A series of generalized linear models are employed to answer these two questions with the use of varying independent variables.
